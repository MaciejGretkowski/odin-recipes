# odin-recipes

This is a repo for the odin-recipes project where I'll be creating a website to hone my learned skills so far which will include the very basics.

Once I am done with this project I will go over and explain the skills I have learned and any challenges.

--Project done reflections below--
I realised that when doing lists it's better to have the li tags on separate lines like this:

li
Your list item
/li

makes it easier to work with even if it takes up more space visually

I also made a whoopsie with the img ref when I added it to index.html not using the src correctly so the image wasn't showing. Fortunately it wasn't a hard fix, I believe it was just a matter of adding a dot before the forward slash but I'd have to check the commits to verify that.
